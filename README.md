# Medcare
Trained a classification model capable of assigning an urgency level. Medcare is a medtech project carried out by Studio3lauchpad's Team 2, a cross-functional team of Data analysts, Product managers, UI/UX, Frontend engineers, and Backend engineers. My role as a Data analyst is to define the triage rules for the product.
